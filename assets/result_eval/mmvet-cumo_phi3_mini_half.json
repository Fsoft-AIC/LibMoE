The heart rate monitor graphic suggests that the handwriting in the first two pages of an exam might be more legible and clear, while the handwriting in the middle pages might be more difficult to read due to increased stress or anxiety.

  "v1_214": "The image displays three pie charts, each representing the units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia, France, and Australia in 1980 and 2000. The charts show the percentage of electricity produced from various sources, such as nuclear power, hydro power, and natural gas. In the 1980 chart, Australia's electricity production was predominantly from nuclear power, with 50% of the total production. France's chart shows a similar distribution, with nuclear power accounting for 50% of the total production. However, the 2000 chart shows a shift in the distribution of electricity production in both countries. In Australia, the 2000 chart shows a decrease in nuclear power production, with only 20% of the total production. Instead, there is an increase in hydro power, which now accounts for 25% of the total production. In France, the 2000 chart shows a decrease in nuclear power production, with only 20% of the total production. Instead, there is an increase in natural gas, which now accounts for 25% of the total production. Overall, the charts show a shift in the sources of electricity production in both countries over the 20-year period. While nuclear power was the dominant source in 1980, there has been a decrease in its contribution to electricity production in both countries by 2000.

  "v1_217": "The diagram below illustrates the process by which the Australian Bureau of Meteorology collects and analyzes data to produce accurate weather forecasts. The process begins with the collection of data from various sources, including satellites, radar screens, and digital buoys. This data is then analyzed and synthesized to create a comprehensive understanding of the current weather conditions. Once the data has been analyzed, it is used to create a synoptic chart, which provides a visual representation of the weather patterns and conditions across a specific region. This chart is then used to make predictions about future weather conditions, which are then broadcasted to the public through various media outlets, including television and radio. The diagram also shows the role of the television news reporter in disseminating the weather forecast to the public. The reporter is responsible for presenting the forecast in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that the public is well-informed about the expected weather conditions. Overall, the diagram highlights the complex process involved in producing accurate weather forecasts, which requires the collection and analysis of a vast amount of data from various sources. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology plays a crucial role in this process, ensuring that the public is well-informed about the weather conditions and can take appropriate measures to stay safe and prepared."
