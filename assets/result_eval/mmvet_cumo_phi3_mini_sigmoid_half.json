Comparing the two countries, it is evident that Brazil has a larger population and more irrigated land than Congo. However, Congo has a higher water consumption per person than Brazil. This could be due to differences in water management practices, infrastructure, and access to clean water sources. The graph and table highlight the importance of efficient water management and conservation, especially in countries with limited water resources. It is crucial to ensure that water is used sustainably and equitably to meet the needs of the population while preserving the environment.",
  "v1_210": "The charts below provide information about the number of marriages and divorces in the USA between 1970 and 2000, as well as the marital status of adult Americans in 1970 and 2000. The first chart shows the number of marriages and divorces in the USA during the years 1970-2000. The number of marriages and divorces both increased over time, with the highest number of marriages occurring in 2000. The number of divorces also increased over time, with the highest number of divorces occurring in 2000. The second chart shows the marital status of adult Americans in 1970 and 2000. In 1970, the majority of adult Americans were married, with a smaller percentage being widowed or divorced. In 2000, the percentage of married adults decreased, while the percentage of widowed and divorced adults increased. Comparing the two charts, it is clear that the number of marriages and divorces in the USA increased over time, while the percentage of married adults decreased. This suggests that while more people were getting married and divorced, the overall percentage of married adults in the population was decreasing. Additionally, the increase in the number of divorces over time may be a contributing factor to the decrease in the percentage of married adults.",

  "v1_214": "The pie charts below show the units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000. In Australia, the pie charts show that in 1980, the majority of electricity was produced by coal, with 50 units, followed by natural gas with 25 units, and nuclear power with 15 units. In 2000, the pie charts show that coal still dominated the electricity production with 130 units, followed by natural gas with 70 units, and nuclear power with 12 units. In France, the pie charts show that in 1980, the majority of electricity was produced by nuclear power, with 100 units, followed by coal with 50 units, and natural gas with 25 units. In 2000, the pie charts show that nuclear power still dominated the electricity production with 200 units, followed by coal with 110 units, and natural gas with 12 units.

  "v1_217": "The diagram below illustrates the process of how the Australian Bureau of Meteorology collects and analyzes information to produce accurate weather forecasts. The process begins with the collection of data from various sources, including satellites, radar, and ground-based weather stations. This data is then fed into a computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to analyze and interpret the information. The computer system then generates a forecast, which is disseminated through various channels, including television, radio, and the internet. The forecast is continuously updated as new data becomes available, ensuring that the public has access to the most up-to-date information. The diagram also shows the various tools and equipment used in the process, such as radar screens, satellite images, and digital buoys. These tools are essential in providing accurate and reliable weather forecasts, which are crucial for a wide range of industries, including agriculture, transportation, and emergency services. Overall, the diagram highlights the importance of technology and data analysis in modern meteorology, and the role that the Australian Bureau of Meteorology plays in providing accurate and reliable weather forecasts to the public."
